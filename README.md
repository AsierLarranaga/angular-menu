# angular-menu-component
Responsive navigation menu for Angular projects.

Component to use in Angular projects to create responsive navigation menus.
The as_modules folder contains a very simple Typescript class to manage the component's CSS styles by Javascript.
You can add this folder/file elsewhere in your project and just change the route in the import statement.

The delayLi variable can change the delay time each ul>li needs to be shown/hidden and it will also change delayBox's delay time automatically.
